Question 3
Why do we need a database? We can store everything in a file, no? 

Ans: Databases are more structured than files. When we use databases we have many RDBMS 
systems which help us quickly access and manipulate data. It also helps in managing the large size 
of data. These systems have many useful features including the data saving feature which helps 
in case of a system crash.  
Many programming languages have special libraries to handle databases quickly.  A database has 
security built into it with access rights and it also helps to store different types of data in 
a single place. The integrity of data stored in a database is never lost due to its ACID properties.
