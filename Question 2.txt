Question 2
Which is an interesting data set you discovered recently? 
Why is it your favorite? No datasets on Kaggle, please. 

Ans: I recently came across this dataset on the website of the Government of the UK which contains 
data on the trends of people washing their hands during the recent COVID - 19 pandemic. Data 
was collected quarterly starting from April 2020. As someone very particular about hygiene, 
especially cleaning my hands before eating food I find this dataset very interesting. People 
were grouped according to their geographical location, gender, marital status etc to name a few 
and were asked a variety of questions like if they wash their hands after contact with animals.
 

The data is primarily numerical and the collection was performed per International standards of market research like ISO 20252 and with the Ipsos MORI Terms and Conditions.
