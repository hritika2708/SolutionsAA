Question 4
How well versed are you on the Unix command line?

I have basic proficiency in Unix. I recently completed a training session on UNIX commands and 
I have a bit of experience using these commands hands-on as well. I am constantly trying to do 
most of my work through the command line to improve my Unix skills.
